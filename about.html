        <p>
            Many in society are going through a lot of emotional trauma and depression. <br>
            They seek an avenue to vent, a means of expression but<br>
            they are most times subjected to silence. Why? Fear! Fear of criticism, <br>
            discrimination and judgement. As a result of this, <br>
            there is an increased rate of suicide. Many however, <br>
            deviate from the path of the just. They begin to excuse themselves from the church <br>
            which is supposed to be a safe ground and a place of refuge,<br>
            due to the high criticism of some folks.
